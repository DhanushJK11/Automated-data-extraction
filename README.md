# Medical Data Extraction

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to automate the extraction of medical data from PDF documents. This includes targeting patient details and prescription information.

## Data Types
- **Patient Details**: Information about patients extracted from the PDFs.
- **Prescription Information**: Details of prescriptions from the documents.

## Technology Utilization

### Libraries
We use various programming libraries designed for PDF parsing and data extraction:
- **PyMuPDF**: For reading and extracting text from PDF files.
- **pytesseract**: For optical character recognition (OCR) to handle scanned documents or images within PDFs.
- **pandas**: For data handling and processing.

### Technologies
- **PDF Parsing**: Extract text and data from PDF documents.
- **OCR Processing**: Recognize text from images or scanned pages within PDFs.

## Process Improvement

### Reduce Manual Effort
This project aims to minimize the need for manual data entry and review, automating the extraction process.

### Enhance Efficiency
By automating data extraction, we aim to speed up the process, facilitating faster access and analysis of medical data.

## Overall Goal
Streamline the extraction process to improve accuracy and workflow in handling medical data.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install required libraries:
